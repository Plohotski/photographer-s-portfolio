## Key skills:
* valid semantic adaptive layout
* easy to maintain readable code
* export styles and graphics from Figma
* using JavaScript to implement the functionality specified in the task

## Technical requirements: 
1. the layout is valid, semantic, corresponding to the layout
2. the application is correctly displayed and works in the latest version of the Google Chrome browser
3. CSS frameworks are not allowed (`bootstrap`)
4. CSS preprocessors allowed (`Sass`), `normalize.css`
5. it is not recommended to use reset styles with `reset.css`
6. it is forbidden to add a layout as a picture when a screenshot of a part of the layout is made and inserted into the layout. For layout, use tags and symbols, images and icons can be added with pictures, not layout elements (buttons, blocks, sections)
